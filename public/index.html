M&amp;M was founded based on the philosophy that “it is more blessed to give than to receive”, and a “not to be served, but to serve” spirit. M&amp;M strives to be a role model for the youth, and to pass the flame of selflessly serving our community." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
